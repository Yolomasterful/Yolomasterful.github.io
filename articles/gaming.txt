Since my younger years I have alays been entranced by gaming and the stories they bring along with them. Some of my favorite games includes Minecraft, Terraria, Factorio, Titanfall 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS2), Arc Raiders, Quantum Break.
I have easily got 20,000+ hrs in various games and have been gaming since I was 6. Of which I started gaming on N64 and PS2 and slowly moved to Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and now ending on PC Gaming where I will most likely reside indefinetly.
