I spent a term at MacEwan doing research into the Grubstake Tephra in Alaska which had a main focus of how to collect and store the data efficiently aswell as fix the problems with current methods of data storage which was outdated and messy.
The program used SQL and Python to create a GUI interface in order to input data from a csv and parse it into proper table structure with the relational model in mind while still being faster than loading Excel.
This also allowed for easy exporting of data back into csv format for usage with excel as was used before this project started.
