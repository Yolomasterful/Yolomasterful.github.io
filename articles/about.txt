I am 22 years old and I live in Edmonton, Alberta. I have 9+ years of programming experience from combined sources such as Middle School, High School, University and Self Teaching.
I am of scottish decent and I previously lived in scotland for my younger years. The name "Logan" signifies "little hollow" in gaelic and my last name is of the "Kerr" clan as well as my middle name of "Lumley" english branch, I also have ties to the Mercer clan on my mothers side.
I have always been an avid gamer since my adolescent years and have always been interested in technology of the sorts. I first got into programming in middle school when I took a course for my extra-curricular credits, This then sparked a long lasting interest in programming as well as development and design.
