I currently run a Homelab Server that contains all of my media and long term documents.
As of right now it is running off of a HP Prodesk 400 with Linux Mint as the operating system.
It is running apps such as Home Assistant, Plex Media Server, and Game servers of the like (Minecraft, Terraria, etc.).
For future additions to my server setup I will use the build that is in my builds page on this site, of which I would like to start using TrueNAS Scale.
This would allow me to use the built in applications for Plex, Nextcloud and Home Assistant. Whilst meaning I can use the built in docker integration to containerize my game servers.
